## Description

WebApp that serve as HelpDesk for the tracking of issues / tickets related to IT.

## Problem

The IT Service Desk department has been facing different issues on the administration of the user requests and issues due to all the communication involve the use of Skype or Email, the administration of the priorities and dates is getting slow and all the requests take a lot of time to complete.

## Solution

We decided to create a web application that allows employees to create requests in form of tickets that helps the IT Service Desk department to handle all the incoming requests in a site instead of  helping the employee using email communication.
